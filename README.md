## Features 
- __Game Menu__

  - This is the main section of the website which includes the game UI. It is responsive and includes the begin quiz, how to play and contact buttons
  - The purpose of this section is to allow the user to navigate the game options easily across all devices without having to use a back button to get to the next page
  ![Game Menu](docs/feature-screenshots/game-menu.png)

- __Title and Welcome Text__

  - As you enter the website, you are greeted with the quiz title and welcome text. This provides a quick overview of the theme of the quiz
  - The text has been written to appeal to children and is light hearted
  - The font styling has also been specifically chosen to appeal to children

  ![Title and Welcome Text](docs/feature-screenshots/title-and-welcome-text.png)

- __Begin Quiz Button__

  - The begin quiz button is the first button you see on the game menu and is in a promient green colour to stand out
  - Once the user clicks the begin quiz button this will take them to the questions and answers page to play the quiz

  ![Begin Quiz Button](docs/feature-screenshots/begin-quiz-button.png)

- __How To Play Button__

  - The how to play button is the next button you see in the game menu. This button is a pop-up modal which once clicked opens up a modal which contains the game rules.
  - The pop-up modal was used for this button to minimise the amount of clicks the player has to make to be able to go back to the game menu screen and play the quiz

  ![How To Play Button](docs/feature-screenshots/how-to-play-button.png)

- __Contact Button and Form__ 

  - The contact button is the last button on the game menu and once clicked takes the player to a dedicated page which has a form on it
  - The form has been designed to be as short as possible, with only 3 fields to input (name, email and comments) and provides a way for the players to provice feedback
  - The form has box shadowing on it and a black border around the input fields to make them stand out
  - The form uses javascript to pre-populate information and on submit instead of the user being sent to the designated action URL as message displays to thank the player for their message and that a memeber of the team will get back to them shortly

  ![Contact Button](docs/feature-screenshots/contact-button.png)

  ![Form](docs/feature-screenshots/form.png)

- __Main Quiz__
 -  The is the main quiz section that has all the questions and answers related to space
 - This part also contains the score, progress bar, countdown timer and question counter
 - It has been designed to be clear and intuitive
 - When a player clicks on an answer, it either turns green(correct) or red (incorrect) and then disables all other options so only one answer can be clicked per question
 - Each time an answer is chosen, a next button will appear to take the player onto the next question
 - If the countdown timer goes to 0 before all answers have been chosen, then a pop up message will be initiated displaying a better luck next time message. Once clicked, the answers and questions will disappear and be replace with a play again button. This will then lead to the quiz being reset once clicked

  ![Main Quiz](docs/feature-screenshots/main-quiz.png)

 - This is the section of the quiz that is displayed once the last question has been answered
 - It shows a congratulations message and dynamically inputs the score the user has achived
 - It also displays a home and play again button

  ![End Page For Quiz](docs/feature-screenshots/end-quiz-page.png)

- __Question Counter__

  - The question counter provides a way for the player to know how many questions they have answered and what question they are on.
  - It makes it easier for them to judge how much of the quiz they have completed and how much time they can spend on all the remaining questions.
  
   ![Question Counter](docs/feature-screenshots/question-counter.png)

- __Progress Bar__
 
 - The progress bar is a visually appealing way to give quick snapshot of how far the player has progressed through the quiz.
 - This compliments the question counter and they both go hand in hand. 
 - The colour orange was chosen as it stands out and has good contrast compared to the other colours being used.
 - The progress bar dynamically fills up after each question has been answered

   ![Progress Bar](docs/feature-screenshots/progress-bar.png)

- __Score__

  - The score system works on a one point per correct question basis.
  - As you progress through the quiz the score is automtically updated in realtime as more and more correct questions are answered.
  - A score feature was added to bring more interactivity, increase the fun element and encourage healthy competition. 

   ![Score](docs/feature-screenshots/score.png)

   - __Countdown Timer__

  - The question counter has been added to the main game quiz to add a bit more of a challenge element to the quiz and make it more enjoyable and rewarding to complete.
  - It counts down in seconds and gives the user 120 second to complete the who quiz. If the user doesn't manage this a play again option is displayed which resets the quiz for them to try again.

  ![Countdown Timer](docs/feature-screenshots/countdown-timer.png)

  ### Future Development
- Currently the form doesn't POST the users data to anywhere as i've not learned how to do this yet. In future, I would like to like this up properly
- Create a high score table with the ability for the player to input their username which saves their individal scores
- Add audio feedback when questions are answered are correct or wrong
- Create multiple levels where the questions get harder the higher the level
- Create a resources page that provides lots more education reading around the topic of space

## Testing 
- The main focus of the testing is on Javascript, HTML and CSS as these are the three languages that were used to create the quiz and static web pages. 
- The testing carried out ensures that the functionality and visual aspects of the website all work as intended. 
- Testing will be done using numerous devices and browsers, ensuring all UX is to a high standard as well as testing the websites accessibility, SEO and validation. 
- I have checked the following:

  - The overall website navigational experience, ensuring the main quiz UI is easy to use, there's  a clear logic flow to the menu and all pages can be accessed quickly
  - All internal links and modals work correctly
  - All forms are working as expected including script checks e.g. if a user fills in a mandatory field in a form an error message is shown, default values are being populated (using JS), optimally formatted for better readability
  - All JS code is being executed without any errors, the main quiz game is working as it should be as well as all of its extra features
  - Contrast checks should report no errors
  - Validation checks for HTML and CSS should report no errors 
  - Lighthouse test scores should be high (within 90-100 range)


### Browser and Device Testing
__Browsers__
- I have tested the website across the four major browsers including Goolge Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari. 
- For each browser, functionality was tested including all quiz features that were built using Javascript, and the responsive design. 
- The website performed as intended and the responsive design and quiz functoins were checked using developer tools across multiple devices with structural integrity holding for the various sizes and no errors occuring.

__Devices Tested__
The website was viewed on a variety of devices and screen sizes including:
- Windows 8.1 Desktop (screen resoultions tested in 2560x1080 and 1920x1080)
- Macbook Pro (13 inch 2015 version)
- Moto G4
- Galaxy S5

- Iphone 5/SE
- Iphone 6/7/8
- Iphone 6/7/8 Plus
- Iphone X
- Ipad
- Ipad Pro
- Surface Duo

A large amount of testing was done to ensure all features of the quiz worked correctly, buttons worked and forms submitted as intended. Family members and the Code Institute Slack community was asked to review the website to point out any bugs or user experience issues.

### W3C and JSHint Validators
The official W3C Markup Validator was used to validate both the html and css of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors within the site. The JSHint code quality checker was used to ensure no errors were present within the javascript code. The links to the results for each html page, css stylesheet and javascript script are below.

### Colour Contrast Checks
I have checked the color contrast of all the pages on the website including index and contact page using the Color Contrast Accessibility Validator by a11y. This ensured that best practise is followed regarding accessibility and maximised readability of the website. The results are shown below.
